# My Project Portfolio

This repository lists my projects with their descriptions and links to their respective repositories.

## Projects

### [XOR Neural Network](https://github.com/romanvoyt/xor_c)
A simple neural network implemented in C to learn the XOR function. The neural network is a fully connected feedforward network with one hidden layer.

### [MNIST classifier from scratch](https://github.com/romanvoyt/mnist_classifier)
The project demonstrates the implementation of a basic neural network from scratch using numpy. It includes functions for forward and backward propagation, weight initialization, and evaluation. The model is trained on the MNIST training set and evaluated on the test set. The training process and results are visualized using Plotly.
